## 🌈 About Me
Full-Stack Dev || Educator || Mental Health Advocate 🧠💛

When I'm not coding, you can find me practicing karate 🥋, throwing around a kettlebell (or two) 💪🏽, playing video games (sometimes I play God of War 🪓, sometimes I play Stardew 🧑🏽‍🌾. There is no in-between), cooking all kinds of food 🧑🏽‍🍳, cuddling with my pup 🐶, or travelling to cool places!
